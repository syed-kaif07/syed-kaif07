## 🧠 What I Actually Do

I build **AI-powered systems** and **full-stack applications** — not tutorial clones.

My focus is on intelligent automation: systems where AI agents make decisions, generate insights, and take action without constant human input. I also practice **vibe coding** — using AI tools to rapidly design, prototype, and ship production-ready apps from idea to deployment. I care about shipping things that work in the real world, not just on localhost.

- 🤖 AI agents that **automatically collect, clean, and analyze** data
- 🧠 Dynamic model selection — picks the best ML model per dataset
- 📊 Generates **explainable, business-ready reports** autonomously
- ☁️ Targeting **SaaS-level deployment** with Django + PostgreSQL backend

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking roles in **AI Engineering**, **Data Engineering**, or **Full Stack Development** where I can build intelligent, scalable systems that deliver measurable business impact.

I'm not looking to just write code — I want to build things that matter.
